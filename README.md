# Title
An ecommerce store (The Store)

## Overview
The Store is an online store with some of the functionalities of the popular ecommerce stores where you can search and add your favourite items into your shopping cart.

## Features 
This is almost a replica of the ministore I built using React and JS. Almost because I changed a few of the features and designs. This Store is built using TypeScript.To highlight some of the differences between this store and the ministore, products are displayed using a Modal rather than routing to a different page on the application as is in the ministore. I also changed the design of the cart page. Apart from these changes, other features are the same. On the homepage, I added filter functionalities so that the user can filter for any product category they want to see. I also added a search bar to the application so that the user can search for any product they want. I added a cart item count feature on the navbar so the user can see the number of products they have added to their cart. When you hover on a product and click on it, the user is taken to a product description page(PDP), where they get a brief description of the product they wish to add to their cart. They can then decide to add such product to their cart or remove it (if they have already added it) or just go back to the homepage using the "Go Home" button.
Replicated the ministore I built with JavaScript using TypeScript and also added a few features
